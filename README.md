Our Direct Sourcing Services help enterprises transform their talent ecosystem to make talent as their competitive advantage.
What is direct sourcing? 
Direct sourcing is the adoption of full time hiring techniques to recruit qualified contingent workers by leveraging the employer brand. Direct sourcing channels include all talent acquisition channels for FTE hiring like social media, job boards, and employee referral networks. 
Direct sourcing solutions are available as built-in solutions in all leading VMS tools like SAP Fieldglass, and VectorVMS. In these tools, direct sourcing solution acts as an augmented sourcing channel which leverages machine learning technology to find the best candidate fit for every open job role in the VMS. Direct sourcing doesn’t disrupt the existing program.
